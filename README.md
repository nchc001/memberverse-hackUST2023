Steps
1) Install and configure XAMPP on your local machine. Ensure that the Apache web server is running.
2) Create a new folder in the "htdocs" directory of your XAMPP installation. This folder will serve as the root directory for your website.
3) Save the web page file in the root directory of your website. The file should have an extension of .html, .php, or any other file extension that is supported by XAMPP.
4) Open your web browser and type "localhost" in the address bar. This should take you to the XAMPP welcome page.
5) Click on the link to your website, which should be listed under the "Your Projects" section of the XAMPP welcome page. This will open your website in the web browser.
6) If you have saved the web page file with a specific filename, you can access it directly by typing "localhost/filename.html" or "localhost/filename.php" in the address bar of your web browser.
